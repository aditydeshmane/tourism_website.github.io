<hr><font size="4"><p style="text-align:jutify"><h3><u>Introduction:</u></h3></p><hr>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (station code: CSTM (mainline)/ST (suburban), is a historic terminal train station and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site </a>in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, formerly known as Victoria Terminus Station, in Mumbai, is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India, blended with themes deriving from Indian traditional architecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The building, <sub>designed by the British architect F. W. Stevens</sub>, became the symbol of Bombay as the ‘Gothic City’ and the major international mercantile port of India. The terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878, according to a High Victorian Gothic design based on late medieval Italian models. Its remarkable stone dome, turrets, pointed arches and eccentric ground plan are close to traditional Indian palace architecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is an outstanding example of the meeting of two cultures, as British architects worked with Indian craftsmen to include Indian architectural tradition and idioms thus forging a new style unique to Mumbai.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway</i>. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India, serving as a terminal for both long-distance- and suburban trains.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h3><hr><li>Victoria Terminus:</li></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify"><hr>This famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British born engineer architect, attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. He received ₹1,614,000 (US$23,000) as the payment for his services. Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig. The design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott's 1873 St Pancras railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style, but it is far closer to Scott's second prize winning entry for Berlin's parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed dome. The style of the station is also similar to other public buildings of the 1870s in Bombay, such as the Elphinstone College but especially the buildings of Bombay University, also designed by G G Scott.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h3><hr><li>Renaming:</li></h3>
<p style="text-align:center"><hr>The station has been renamed several times. It was built to replace Bori Bunder, the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from 1853 to 1888, and was named Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1996, the station was renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in honour of Emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">In December 2016, the Fadnavis Ministry passed a resolution to change the name to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in the Maharashtra Assembly and in May 2017, the home ministry officially sent a letter to the state government denoting the name change, following which the station was yet again renamed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. However, both the former names "VT" as well as "CST" along with the current name "CSMT" are popularly used.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The station took ten years to complete, the longest for any building of that era in Bombay.</font></p></blockquote><hr><hr>
