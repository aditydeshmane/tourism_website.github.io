<h2><b><center><i>Adventure Tourism in India:</h2></b></center></i>
<p  "font family:Times New Roman">The tourism industry in India has emerged as the largest sector in the service industry as it contributes over 6.2% of its GDP.
 In addition, it provides jobs to more than 8.7% of the employed people in the country.
 Every year, the number of tourists making to India grows by over 5 million.
 In International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Development addition to the foreign visitors, there are more than 525 million local tourists in the country.</p>

<p "font family:Times New Roman">The overall size of the Indian tourism industry is around $100 billion and it is expected that it would grow to over $275 billion in the next decade.
 The Ministry of Tourism can be credited for this huge success rate because it is aggressively engaged in promoting the industry.
 It was in order to promote tourism in the country that the Incredible India program was started. 
The main tagline of this program,<b><i> “Atithi Devo Bhava” </b></i>compares guests to God.
However, the tourism industry in India is not as beautiful as it may appear on the top.
 The insufficient number of available hotel rooms, pushes India behind several other countries. 
It was only a year ago when the country had around 25,000 hotel rooms for its tourists.
 The next reason for tourism to fall behind is with regard to the complex process of getting a visa into the country.
 Because the airports in the country are crowded, it is not taken well by International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Development foreign visitors.
 However, it is still expected that the tourism industry is going to grow in the near future.</p>
