<h2><p style="color:red">History of Sky Diving:</p></h2><br>
         <h3><p><p style="text-align: justify;">Skydiving, also called parachuting, use of a parachute—for either recreational or competitive purposes—to slow a diver’s descent to the ground after jumping from an 
airplane or other high place. The sport traces its beginnings to the descents made from a hot-air balloon by the French aeronaut André-Jacques Garnerin in 1797, but 
modern skydiving is usually performed from a propeller-driven airplane. At events such as the annual World Free Fall Convention in Quincy, Illinois, however, 
parachutists are afforded the opportunity to jump from such diverse craft as hot-air balloons, helicopters, and a Boeing 727. Typical jump altitudes in modern times 
for experienced skydivers range from 7,500 to 15,000 feet (2,300 to 4,600 metres) above ground level, yielding a freefall time of between 40 and 85 seconds. The length
 of the freefall (the time between exiting the aircraft and deploying the parachute) is dependent upon such factors as exit altitude, opening altitude, and fall rate.
 The fall rate is determined by the jumpsuit the skydiver wears and the way in which the suit conforms to the body during the freefall (a looser suit offers more 
resistance to the air and slows the fall) and by the diver’s body configuration relative to the ground. Freefall speeds for skydivers falling “belly to earth” (the
 standard arched position) range from 110 to 130 miles per hour (180 to 210 km per hour). Descent speeds in excess of 330 mph have been recoded for those skydivers 
in speed skydiving competitions (in which the diver falls headfirst with the body in a streamlined position), and those as slow as 40 mph have been noted for 
skydivers using extended-wing “birdman” suits. The altitude at which a parachutist opens the canopy varies, but 2,500 feet is usual. With most parachutes, the 
skydiver initiates deployment by throwing a pilot chute into the airstream (other parachutes have pilot chutes that are automatically released by pulling an attached 
cord). The pilot chute is a small chute opened by air resistance that acts to pull the main parachute out from the bag in which the parachutes are encased. The main 
parachute increases the skydiver’s air resistance and slows the diver’s fall to the ground to a speed of about 10 mph. Modern ram-air parachutes are made of seven to 
nine nylon cells that inflate and act as a wing, or glider; these canopies allow the parachutist to steer and sail gently to the ground.To maximize safety, sport 
skydivers wear two parachutes, one main and one reserve. This is prescribed by law in the U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations and in the aviation regulations of many 
other countries as well. Additionally, skydivers use a variety of altitude-sensing devices in order to know when to deploy their parachutes.</p></p></h3><br>

<h2><p style="color:red">Skydiving in India: Everything You Need To Know</p></h2><br>
<a href="https://www.indianholiday.com/blog/best-places-for-skydiving-in-india/" ><b>more information about skuba diving's places in india</a><br>
<h3><p><p style="text-align: justify;">Does it set your adrenaline pumping and heart racing when you see adventure junkies dive from 10,000 feet above in the sky with nothing but only a parachute strapped on? If yes, then your adventure-loving heart is yearning for an experience in skydiving in India.

When you finally decide to strap-on and dive, this information will come in handy.</p></p></h3><br>

<h2><p style="color:red">Here are some types of sky dives –<br></p></h2><br>
<ol>
<list type="1">
<h3><li style="color:blue"> Tendem Jump:</li>

<p>
<center>
      <a href="https://ibb.co/59vhQcB">
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/ky02LcQ/Tendem-jump.jpg" alt="Tendem-jump" border="2" height="250" width="300" border="2"></a>
</center>
</p>

<p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tandem skydiving is the best choice for the first timers. In this jump, you will be attached to an experienced instructor and they operator the equipment and do the maneuver. These skydivers are essentially students and they do nothing except playing a part in the sport. The passengers are trained about the position to exit and the correct posture to make and lifting your legs up. This is a good way to experience skydiving with a safe and experienced diver. All the passenger does is enjoys the experience.</p></p> 
<p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here you are connected to an instructor via a harness. Both of you jump together using the same parachute and the instructor pulls the cord. This is the simplest form of skydiving in India, and needs minimal instructions. The best part is that the entire experience will be recorded so that you can re-live the thrill even after it is all over, for the rest of your life.</p></p>

<li style="color:blue">Static Line Jump:</li>

<p>

       <a href="https://ibb.co/Gdx882y">
       <img src="https://i.ibb.co/nwgYYc9/Static-line-jump.jpg" alt="Static-line-jump" border="2" height="250" width="300" border="2"></a>
</center>
</p>

<p><p style="text-align: justify;">This type of skydiving requires a day of training and it is done solo. The jump is done from 4000 ft above ground and it is called static line jump as the parachute opens by static-line attached to aircraft. So technically there is no freefall. The skydiving is done by you alone but there is a supervisor who looks after the exit and later descents. This is an ideal group activity and s a great way for adventure enthusiasts to expand their horizon.</p></p>
<p><p style="text-align: justify;">The jump is made from only 3,000 feet and requires upto six hours of training. In this skydive you are connected with a cord to the aircraft, and the parachute opens automatically after around 3 seconds of free fall with no action required by the diver.</p></p>

<li style="color:blue">Accelerated Free Fall:</li>

<p>
<center>
      <a href="https://ibb.co/vd72y4W">
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/YdzvnBS/Accelerated-Free-Fall.jpg" alt="Accelerated-Free-Fall" border="2" height="250" width="300" border="2"></a>
</center>
</p>

<p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is ideal type of jump that is best to teach new skydivers. It is efficient way to learn and you need training to understand how to fly your body and use the parachute to go back to the ground. The ground training equips the riders what all contingencies. There are instructors who help you jump but they will hold you first and slowly leave you on your own. Post certain jumps, the rider gets a license.</p></p>
<p><p style="text-align: justify;">This one is the real deal, where you jump without any attachments and free fall. It is one of the most challenging experiences of sky diving in India. It requires both classroom instructions and practical training, considering the serious nature of this dive and is done from at least 13,000 feet.</p></p>

<h2><p style="color:red">Interesting Skydiving Facts:</h2></p><hr>
<h3><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Skydivers usually jump from planes but they can also be completed from helicopters and hot air balloons.</li></p>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">When a skydiving student is attached to a professional skydiver for the duration of the jump it is referred to as tandem skydiving.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Tandem skydiving is a popular way for new skydivers to make their first jump.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">While freefalling the wind passes by at a speed of 100 miles per hour.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">While skydiving it is impossible to hear other skydivers. Sometimes ears pop during the dive.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">There are approximately 3.1 million skydives around the world each year.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">There are approximately 55 deaths from skydiving each year. This is equal to less than 1% of the total jumps making the sport safer than driving a car.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Jay Stokes created a new world record when he completed 640 jumps in one day. Each jump took place less than two and a quarter minutes apart.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">The most difficult group skydive took place in 2006 when 400 skydivers jumped from 23,000 feet and formed a flower arrangement in the sky.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">The first woman to skydive with a parachute from a moving aircraft was Georgina Broadwick. She jumped over Los Angeles on June 21st, 1913.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">The youngest tandem skydiver was Toni Stadler. He was only four years old when he jumped with Paul Lutge from 10,000 feet above the earth.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">The oldest skydiver on record was at one time 100 year old Fred Mack. His first jump was at 95 and he swore if he lived to 100 he would repeat the jump, which he did.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2004 the oldest skydiver on record became Frank Moody who made a tandem jump at the age of 101.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">When the parachute is deployed the skydiver does not go back up in the air. This is an illusion that occurs because the camera man doing the filming continues to fall while the skydiver slows from the parachute opening.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Although it looks like it might hurt when the parachute opens they are designed to open slowly and there is little to no jolt and no pain.</p></li>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">A skydiver over Sweden got the first tattoo during a jump when he had the letters WFFT tattooed on his body. This stands for World's First Freefall Tattoo.</p></li></h3>

<h2><p style="color:orange">History of Scuba Diving:</h2></p><br>
  
      

                <h3><p><p style="text-align: justify;">Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses an apparatus which is completely independent of surface supply to breathe under
water.The name 
"scuba", an acronym of "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus", was first used by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba 
divers carry 
their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and 
longer
underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.Although the use of compressed air is common, a mixture of air and oxygen called enriched air or nitrox has become 
popular
due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intak e during long or repetitive dives.</p></p> <p><p style="text-align: justify;">Breathing gas diluted with helium may be used to reduce nitrogennarcosis. Open 
circuit
scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high 
pressure
which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for range extension, decompression gas or emergency breathing
gas.
Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases.</p></p><p><p style="text-align: justify;"> The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit
, 
so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open circuit for the same 
gas
consumption; they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than open circuit scuba which makes them attractive to covert military diversto avoid detection, scientific 

divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference. Scuba diving may be done.</p></p></h3><br>

<h2><p style="color:orange">What is Scuba Diving – The Attraction?</p></h2><br>
<p><h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Scuba diving is mainly done for the attraction of the unattainable undersea world.  It is one area of nature that mankind has not been able to fully control, we simply are not able to breathe underwater.  Hence, scuba diving gives us an opportunity to be in that underwater world, even if it is just for a limited amount of time.

Of course, the underwater world is beautiful as well, with many people opting for scuba diving in Asia or scuba diving in the Red Sea or the Great Barrier Reef, said to be some of the world’s best scuba diving locations.  The different colors and marine wildlife are so impressive in all these locations that people find themselves returning over and over again.</h3></p></p><br>

 

<h2><p style="color:orange">What is Scuba Diving – Technical Points?</p></h2><br>
<h3><p><p style="text-align: justify;">Diving underwater is something that has attracted mankind since they figured out that there was a living world under the seas.  SCUBA is an abbreviation for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, in other words, equipment to allow us to breathe underwater.

The air that is in the tanks is compressed air as we know it outside, so parts nitrogen, parts oxygen, and some other gases as well.  Many people mistakenly believe that the air is pure oxygen, but that would actually poison the divers!  Because of the nitrogen in the compressed air, divers need to be very careful when diving to greater depths, as nitrogen narcosis can occur, which has the same effect as excessive alcohol.  This is easily solved by going back up to shallower waters.

A more serious effect of nitrogen is known as Caisson’s Disease also known as decompression sickness, which is when nitrogen starts to form bubbles in the diver’s body.  This becomes an issue when the diver returns to the surface and normal air pressure and can lead to death.  This is why one of the most important things to remember for divers is to never go too deep too quickly and never to go back to the surface too quickly.</p></p></h3><br>

<h2><p style="color:orange">What is Scuba Diving – Safety?</p></h2><br>
<h3><p><p style="text-align: justify;">The main thing to remember with scuba diving is that [you need to be safe].  Do not go diving on your own and don’t be tempted into buying diving gear and simply giving it a go without the proper training.  Research some good diving schools if you want to go scuba diving.

Scuba diving is incredibly popular, so whether you want to go diving in Asia or diving in the Red Sea, for example, diving in Sharm El Sheikh, or anywhere else in the world for that matter, you will be able to find good diving schools in those areas.  Touristic places, like diving in Sharm El Sheikh, will probably have a range of diving schools, so see if you can do some research on them before your holiday.</h3></p></p><br>

 

<h2><p style="color:orange">What is Scuba Diving – Some Interesting facts</p></h2><br>
<h3><p>Did you know…<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For recreational divers, the depth limit is between 30 and 40 meters (equating to 100 to 133 feet).  If you want to go deeper, special training or a specially trained buddy is required.
Nuno Gomes holds the world record for deepest scuba dive at 318 meters (or 1044 feet).  He defeated John Bennet (deceased), who dove to 308 meters (or 1016 feet).  There is a French diver, Pascal Bernabé, who maintains that he has been able to dive deeper (330 meters or 1083 feet), but this is unconfirmed.</h3></p></p><br>

<h2><p style="color:orange">What is Scuba Diving – Some Interesting Dives</p></h3><br>
<h3><p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you do enjoy scuba diving, there are a couple of things you can do to make it even more interesting.  There are many artificial reefs, for example.  These artificial reeds have been created either to restore destroyed coral or as a scientific experiment to see how coral grows and how it attracts other marine life.  There are many wrecks, for example, that have been purposely sunken to create artificial reefs.

If you have nerves of steel, you may want to consider going for a dive with sharks!  A cage dive with sharks can be the experience of a lifetime.  You are basically enclosed in a steel cage and lowered into a shoal of shark, attracted by fish guts beforehand.<br>

The main thing with scuba diving will always be: STAY SAFE and ENJOY.</p></p></h3><br>
