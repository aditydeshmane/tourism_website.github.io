<p style="text-align:center; font-family :Times New Roman" >Being a soft-adventure sport, almost anyone in reasonable physical condition can go trekking.
 To get initiated into trekking begin with day hikes, returning to your starting point in the evening.
 Move on to a multi-day trek which is relatively easy, in order to get to know your ability and aptitude.
 You can venture into the mountains with an experienced trekker, join an adventure club, or go with a reputed adventure travel company. It is not a good idea to venture out into the mountains alone – unless you happen to be a distant relative of the mythical Himalayan yeti (or an aspiring Reinhold Messner, the first person in the world to have climbed all fourteen 8000m peaks, including the first oxygen-less ascent and later the first solo ascent of Everest).
A basic knowledge of camp craft, map reading and first aid is essential before you go trekking.
 It’s a good idea to do an adventure course from one of the mountaineering/ adventure institutes in India.
 A basic course in mountaineering and a first-aid course are recommended if you decide to take it up more seriously and trek to remote/high-altitude areas.
 Get as much information about the trekking area as possible – the people, their culture, the geography, terrain, medical/rescue facilities and weather conditions – before you go.</p>

<b><h2><center><i>Trekking in India</h2></b></center></i>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family :Times New Roman" >Trekking in India started when the land was inhabited in prehistoric times.
 There are perhaps as many trekking routes in India as there are Indians.
 It was in the 1970’s and 1980’s that trekking started gaining in popularity as a recreational/adventure sport.
 A number of religious sites and shrines across the country, especially in Jammu and Kashmir, and in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand – such as Badrinath, Amarnath, Gangotri, Hemkund, Joshimath, Kedarnath, Vaishno Devi and Yamunotri – entail trekking for a couple of days in the mountains.
 Trekking in India has grown in leaps and bounds and the current trekking scenario is very promising, with thousands of Indians and foreigners hitting trekking trails each year.
What India can boast of is some of the most stunning trekking routes in the world – many of the mountain passes in the Ladakh and Zanskar Himalayas are above 5000m.
 But there are plenty of gentler and smaller trails, at different altitudes, both in the mountains and in the forests.
 If you’re looking for less arduous hikes, you’ll find plenty in in the Western Ghats and the Nilgiri Hills of south India.</p>
