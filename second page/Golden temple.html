<h2 style="font-family:times new roman;color:red"><b><i>Interesting facts about Amritsar Golden Temple</i></b></h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Named after the gold covering</b></li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<i>Golden temple was named after the outer layer of gold foil that covers the entire temple. after the death of guru govind singh, this gurudwara was constantly attacked and destroyed by the islamic rulers. in the year 1762, this religious heritage was completely blown away with gunpowder. after the devastation, maharaja ranjit singh, a brave sikh ruler rebuilt the rich heritage with marble and adorned it with gold. he took over the entire complex and appointed desa singh to look after its operation and maintenance.</i></h>

<p style="font-family:times new roman"><p style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Baba deep singh died in the Golden temple</b></li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<i>Baba deep singh is one of the most honourable martyrs in the history of india. he vowed to take his last breath at sri harmandir sahib. in 1757, when amritsar was invaded by jahan khan, baba deep singh fought the battle with five thousand men. during the fierce battle, his head was separated from the body. however, he held his head with one hand and gallantly fought with the enemies in order to reach the shrine and die on its floor.</i></h></p>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Times new Roman"><p style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Set up below the ground level</b></li>
</p>
<h style="font-family:Times new Roman" ><i><p style="text-align: justify;">
The first floor of the temple is submerged in the amrit sarovar and is only visible during kar sewa. as the Golden temple is uniquely set up at a lower level below the ground, the stairs leading to the shrine go downwards. this is quite contrary to the hindu temples that are always built on an elevated platform above the ground. this distinct feature at the golden temple signifies humble living.</i></h>
</p></p>

<p style="font-family: Times new Roman"><p style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>One of the finest example of indian and mughal architectural style</b></li></p>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<i>The exquisite Golden temple is a unique blend of the hindu as well as the islamic architecture.The shrine is decorated with marble sculptures and paintings that look similar to the taj mahal. The dome at the top is made from pure gold and the gurudwara is also encased with intricate gold panels. Even the ceiling is adorned with precious stones and gold. In the inner sanctum, the priests continue to chant from the holy guru granth sahib which adds to the unspoken charm of the golden temple.</i></p></p>
</p>

<b><li>Golden temple named after the 24-karat gold covering</b></li>
<h style="font-family:times new roman"><p style="text-align: justify;">
<i>The Golden temple that you see today interestingly was not covered with an inch of gold when it was first constructed.  In the year 1762, this religious heritage site was complete, destroyed by islamic rulers. It was then that maharaja ranjit singh, a brave sikh ruler rebuilt the entire temple and added a sparkling outer covering of gold to the marble structure. 500 kg of pure 24-karat of gold worth Rs.130 crores, covered the temple in all its glory and that is when the sri harmandir sahib got famously referred to as the golden temple of Amritsar.</i></h>
