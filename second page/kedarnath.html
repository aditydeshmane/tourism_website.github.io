<p style="font-family: times new roman"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strike><big><b>A¥odhya</b></big></strike><sub>  assumed to 
be the birthplace of Lord Rama,</sub> it is a religious place in India that has been surrounded by controversy 
since about a decade now but yet, has so much colour and spirituality to see for its tourists taking the 
form of various <u>attractions here including Ram Janmabhoomi and various other temples.</u>Owing to the 
belief as the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadh) has been regarded as one of the seven most important
 pilgrimage sites (Saptapuri) for Hindus. It is believed that the birth spot of Rama was marked by a temple, 
which is said to have been demolished by the orders of the <sup>Mughal emperor Babur and a disputed mosque</sup>
 erected in its place. In 1992, it lead to the demolition of<strike> Babri mosque by Hindu mobs with the aim to 
replace it with a temple of Rama. </strike>The Ayodhya dispute concerned activism by Hindu groups to rebuild 
a grand temple of Rama at the site of Janmabhoomi.[5] The five judges of the Supreme Court bench heard
 the title dispute cases from August to October 2019. On<sub> 9 November 2019, </sub>the Supreme Court, headed by
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, vacated the previous decision and ruled that the land belonged to the
 government per tax records.<b> It further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu 
temple. </b>It also ordered the government to give an alternative 5 acres (2.0 ha) of land to the Uttar Pradesh
 Sunni Central Waqf Board to build a mosque to replace the demolished Babri Masjid. <i>The construction 
of Ram Mandir commenced in August 2020.[6]</i></p></p><br>
