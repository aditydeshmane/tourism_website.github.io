<h2><p style="font-family:Times New Roman">The plateau was always under local pressures of grazing and burning. Domestic cattle compete to a certain extent with wild mammals. <br>
Disturbance was also caused by the road that passes through the plateau. <br>
Many road kills of snakes have been reported. Addition of dung leads to eutrophication. Heavy trampling by cattle and people has created many paths on the plateau.<br>
 It is not possible to judge the impact of these activities on the plateau diversity, as no baseline data is available.<br>
Recent popularity and sudden growth in tourism are at present the most serious threats, not only to the plateau but also to the surrounding areas. The alarming rise in the number of tourists became a serious concern since 2008. <br>
The easily visible ecological impacts of tourism are high levels of vegetation trampling, microhabitat damage and solid waste problem.<br>
The not so easily visible impacts are changing land-use in surrounding area, socio-economic and cultural changes in the surrounding villages. <br>
Both these are irreversible unless immediate measures are taken. A Joint Forest Management Committee has been constituted to manage tourist inflow. <br>
The most serious threat is establishment of invasive weeds, which are introduced through foreign soils and can compete with the indigenous flora<p></h2><br><br>
