Kaas plateau is rich in its biodiversity.Many species are observed on plateau which are new to the Botanical Science.Many of the endemic,endangered plants are found on plateau.More than 850 species of flowering plants are reported on the plateau.624 species have entered in the red data book.Out of these 624 species,39 are found in Kass region.
The main plateau of Kas has been served in detail by ,main researchers.The other three plateausnhave not been serveyed.Earliest work on the plateau was by chavan et el.Dr. Bachulkar studied endemic  flora of this area. Bhattarai has identified 103 species of local concern on kas plateau and surrounding area.Lekhak and Yadav 
have documented floristic wealth of the Kas Plateau.The vegetation and biodiversity values of the Kas Plateau as a representative site of the threatened rocky plateau habitat has been discussed by Porembski and Watve.One study has been published on the pollination mechanism.A list of lichen species from Kas area has been compiled
by Dr.Gayatri Chitale and Archana Dube during their doctoral studies from Maharashtra which includes 14 species of macro lichens and 6 species of macro lichens found on Kas plateau.Many popular books have appeared in Marathi and English,including photoguides by Shrotri,Shrikant Ingalhallikar,and other by Satara Forest Department.

<h2><p style="font-family:Times new Roman;text-align:left;"><b>It is a biodiversity hotspot known for various types of seasonal wild flowers bloom and numerous species of endemic butterflies annually in the months of August and September.
The plateau is situated at an altitude of 1200 metres and is approximately 10 square kilometers in area. Kaas has more than 850 different species of flowering plants. 
These include orchids, shrubs such as the Karvy, and carnivorous plants such as Drosera Indica. Kaas Pathar is a plateau made from volcanic rocks in the Satara district of Maharashtra, and comes under the biosphere of the Western Ghats. 
The flora of kaas i.e. the entire flowering plants and their related plants are typically restricted to that particular locality only. 
This is because the plateau is largely formed of basalt which is directly exposed to atmosphere. The basalt is almost covered entirely by a thin cover of soil formed due to erosion and has accumulated a layer of not more than 25 mm or so on.Kaas Pathar is a plateau made from volcanic rocks in the Satara district of Maharashtra, and comes under the biosphere of the Western Ghats. Hailed as Maharashtraâ€™s answer to the Valley of Flowers, Kaas is famous for its overwhelming carpets of flowers which come alive by the fag end of the monsoons.
 During this time, the plateau receives an average rainfall of 2000 mm, and much of the water seeps through the porous laterite rocks. The whole area is covered with flowers of varying colours, the dominant colour changing with the time of the year. 
More than 450 species of flowers, orchids and even carnivorous plants such as Drosera Indica are found in Kaas.<b></p></h2>

<hr><hr><h1><p style="font-family:Times new Roman; color:DarkMagenta"><u>VARITIES OF FLOWERS</u></p></h1></hr></hr><br>
<h2><p style="font-family:Times new Roman;text-align:left;">About 350 varieties of flowers are currently blooming in diversity reverse.
The reserve forest remains of bounds for visitors as the forest department and district administration are yet to decide on permitting tourists in the area 
the colour of the plateau changes with the season.However, many flowers, including the rare wildflowers, bloom throughout the year. 
Naturally, the bloom will last for a more extended period this year because of the Covid restrictions, and one can, therefore, look forward to more varieties of flora in the coming season. </p></h2>
